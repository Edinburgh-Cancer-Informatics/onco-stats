### Intermediate Level Textbooks

These texts bridge basic concepts and advanced applications, with emphasis on practical implementation in cancer research and clinical trials.

#### Regression Modelling Strategies (2nd Edition)

**Author:** Frank E. Harrell Jr.  
**Publisher:** Springer  
**Software:** R (with rms package)

**Why recommended:** Good reading for oncology researchers conducting multivariable analyses. Addresses real-world challenges including missing data, model validation using bootstrap methods, survival analysis, and logistic regression. Comprehensive R implementation makes it ideal for UK trainees using RStudio. Particularly valuable for cancer prognosis studies and clinical trial analysis.

**Key topics:** Survival regression, ordinal regression, model validation, handling missing data, avoiding categorization of continuous variables

---

#### Clinical Prediction Models: A Practical Approach

**Author:** Ewout W. Steyerberg  
**Publisher:** Springer

**Why recommended:** Ideal companion to Harrell's text. Provides additional explanations, examples, and simulations of modern statistical methods. Highly relevant for developing and validating prognostic models in oncology.
