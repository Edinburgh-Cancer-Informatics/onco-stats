**Correct answers: A, B, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – This is the definition of epidemiology: the study of the distribution and determinants of disease in populations.

- **B) TRUE** – A key purpose of epidemiological studies is to identify factors associated with disease occurrence.

- **C) FALSE** – Epidemiological studies are mostly **observational** in design, in contrast to experimental studies which involve interventions.

- **D) TRUE** – Epidemiology considers a wide range of determinants including biological (age, sex), social (deprivation), behavioural (smoking, diet), and environmental factors.

- **E) FALSE** – Epidemiology was first developed to discover and understand possible causes of **infectious diseases** like smallpox, typhoid, and polio. It later expanded to include chronic diseases.

## Question 2: Types of Observational Studies

Which of the following statements about observational study designs are TRUE?

- A) Cross-sectional studies are carried out at a single point in time
- B) Cohort studies follow a group of individuals forward in time
- C) Case-control studies compare individuals with disease to those without disease
- D) All observational studies are prospective
- E) Ecological studies use groups of individuals as the unit of observation

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Cross-sectional studies capture a "snapshot" of the population at a single point in time.

- **B) TRUE** – Cohort studies take a group of individuals and follow them forward in time to assess disease occurrence.

- **C) TRUE** – Case-control studies compare the characteristics of cases (with disease) to controls (without disease).

- **D) FALSE** – Observational studies can be either prospective (health event has yet to happen) or retrospective (health event has already occurred). Cohort studies can be either; case-control studies are usually retrospective.

- **E) TRUE** – Ecological studies use aggregated data from groups (e.g., populations defined by geography) rather than individual-level data.

</details>

## Question 3: Prospective vs Retrospective Studies

Which of the following statements about the timing of studies are TRUE?

- A) A prospective study follows participants forward in time from exposure to outcome
- B) A retrospective study looks back in time from outcome to exposure
- C) Cohort studies can only be prospective
- D) Case-control studies are typically retrospective
- E) In a retrospective cohort study, data on exposure and outcome have already been collected

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, D, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Prospective studies follow participants forward from the time of enrolment to observe future outcomes.

- **B) TRUE** – Retrospective studies look backward from the outcome (disease) to investigate prior exposures.

- **C) FALSE** – Cohort studies can be either prospective or retrospective. In a retrospective cohort study, historical records are used to identify the cohort and follow them through to outcomes that have already occurred.

- **D) TRUE** – Case-control studies are usually retrospective because they start with cases who already have the disease and look back at exposures.

- **E) TRUE** – Retrospective cohort studies use existing data (e.g., medical records, employment records) where both exposure and outcome information is already available.

## Question 4: Prevalence

Which of the following statements about prevalence are TRUE?

- A) Prevalence is the proportion of individuals with a condition in a population at a point in time
- B) Point prevalence measures disease at a single moment in time
- C) Period prevalence measures disease over a specified time interval
- D) Prevalence is a measure of new cases of disease
- E) Cross-sectional studies are suitable for estimating prevalence

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Prevalence is defined as the proportion (or percentage) of individuals with a particular condition in the population.

- **B) TRUE** – Point prevalence = Number with disease at a single time point / Total number studied at that time point.

- **C) TRUE** – Period prevalence = Number with disease over a time period / Total number studied during the same period.

- **D) FALSE** – Prevalence includes all existing cases (both new and pre-existing). **Incidence** is the measure of new cases.

- **E) TRUE** – Cross-sectional studies are specifically designed to estimate prevalence because they capture a snapshot of disease status at one point in time.

</details>

## Question 5: Incidence

Which of the following statements about incidence are TRUE?

- A) Incidence is the number of new cases of a condition occurring in a population over a set time period
- B) Incidence risk assumes all individuals are followed for the complete study period
- C) Incidence rate accounts for variations in follow-up time using person-years
- D) Cross-sectional studies are suitable for measuring incidence
- E) Cohort studies can be used to estimate incidence rates

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Incidence counts only new cases occurring during a specified time period.

- **B) TRUE** – Incidence risk (cumulative incidence) assumes the entire population at risk is followed for the specified period. In practice, this is often not the case.

- **C) TRUE** – Incidence rate uses person-time (typically person-years) in the denominator to account for individuals being lost to follow-up or entering the study at different times.

- **D) FALSE** – Cross-sectional studies cannot measure incidence because they only capture disease status at a single point in time, not new cases over time.

- **E) TRUE** – Cohort studies follow individuals over time and are specifically designed to measure incidence rates.

## Question 6: Incidence Calculations

A cohort study follows 500 women for 5 years. During follow-up, 25 women develop breast cancer. The total person-years of follow-up is 2,300 (some women were lost to follow-up or developed cancer before 5 years).

Which of the following are TRUE?

- A) The incidence risk is 25/500 = 5%
- B) The incidence rate is 25/2300 = 1.09 per 100 person-years
- C) The incidence rate is more accurate than incidence risk when there is loss to follow-up
- D) Person-years takes into account that not all individuals were followed for the same duration
- E) If no one was lost to follow-up, the total person-years would be 2,500

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D, E are all TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Incidence risk = Number of new cases / Number at risk at start = 25/500 = 0.05 = 5%.

- **B) TRUE** – Incidence rate = Number of new cases / Total person-time = 25/2300 = 0.0109 = 1.09 per 100 person-years.

- **C) TRUE** – When there is loss to follow-up, incidence rate is preferred because it accounts for the actual time each person contributed to the study.

- **D) TRUE** – Person-years sums the follow-up time contributed by each individual, whether they completed the full study or not.

- **E) TRUE** – If all 500 women were followed for the full 5 years: 500 × 5 = 2,500 person-years.

## Question 7: Cohort Study Structure

In the standard 2×2 table for a cohort study, which of the following are TRUE?

- A) Rows represent exposure status (exposed vs unexposed)
- B) Columns represent disease outcome (disease vs no disease)
- C) The incidence in the exposed group is calculated as a/(a+b)
- D) The incidence in the unexposed group is calculated as c/(c+d)
- E) The relative risk is calculated as (a+c)/(b+d)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

Using the standard table layout:

|                | Disease: Yes | Disease: No | Incidence |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Exposed: Yes**   | a            | b           | a/(a+b)   |
| **Exposed: No**    | c            | d           | c/(c+d)   |

- **A) TRUE** – Rows represent the exposure categories.

- **B) TRUE** – Columns represent the disease outcome categories.

- **C) TRUE** – Incidence in exposed = a/(a+b), where a = exposed with disease, b = exposed without disease.

- **D) TRUE** – Incidence in unexposed = c/(c+d), where c = unexposed with disease, d = unexposed without disease.

- **E) FALSE** – The relative risk = [a/(a+b)] / [c/(c+d)], not (a+c)/(b+d). The formula compares the incidence in exposed to incidence in unexposed.

## Question 8: Relative Risk Interpretation

A cohort study of smoking and lung cancer reports a relative risk (RR) of 10.0. Which of the following interpretations are TRUE?

- A) Smokers have 10 times the risk of lung cancer compared to non-smokers
- B) The risk of lung cancer is 1000% higher in smokers
- C) RR = 10 indicates a strong positive association between smoking and lung cancer
- D) A relative risk of 1.0 would indicate no association
- E) The absolute risk of lung cancer in smokers can be determined from the RR alone

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – RR = 10.0 means the incidence in smokers is 10 times that in non-smokers.

- **B) FALSE** – The risk is 900% higher (RR - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 = 900%), not 1000%. Smokers have 10 times the risk, which is 9 times more (900% increase).

- **C) TRUE** – RR = 10 represents a strong positive association, as values much greater than 1 indicate substantially elevated risk.

- **D) TRUE** – RR = 1.0 indicates that the risk is identical in exposed and unexposed groups (no association).

- **E) FALSE** – The RR is a ratio of risks. To know the absolute risk, you need the actual incidence rates in each group. For example, RR = 10 could represent 1% vs 0.1%, or 10% vs 1%.

## Question 9: Relative Risk Calculation

A cohort study investigates low serum ferritin and anaemia in 30 women. The results are:

| Serum Ferritin | Anaemia: Yes | Anaemia: No | Total |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Low (<20 μg/L) | 7            | 8           | 15    |
| Normal         | 2            | 13          | 15    |

Which of the following are TRUE?

- A) The incidence of anaemia in the low ferritin group is 7/15 = 46.7%
- B) The incidence of anaemia in the normal ferritin group is 2/15 = 13.3%
- C) The relative risk is (7/15)/(2/15) = 3.5
- D) Women with low ferritin have 3.5 times the risk of developing anaemia
- E) The relative risk indicates that low ferritin is protective against anaemia

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Incidence in exposed (low ferritin) = 7/15 = 0.467 = 46.7%.

- **B) TRUE** – Incidence in unexposed (normal ferritin) = 2/15 = 0.133 = 13.3%.

- **C) TRUE** – RR = (7/15)/(2/15) = 0.467/0.133 = 3.5.

- **D) TRUE** – The risk of developing anaemia among women with low serum ferritin is 3.5 times the risk among women with normal ferritin. Alternatively, the risk is 250% higher (3.5 - 1 = 2.5 = 250%).

- **E) FALSE** – RR > 1 indicates an **increased** risk, not a protective effect. Low ferritin is associated with higher risk of anaemia.

## Question 10: Case-Control Study Structure

Which of the following statements about case-control studies are TRUE?

- A) Cases are individuals with the disease of interest
- B) Controls are individuals without the disease
- C) The study looks back in time to assess prior exposures
- D) We can directly calculate the incidence of disease from a case-control study
- E) We estimate the odds of exposure in cases compared to controls

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Cases are defined as individuals who have the disease or condition being studied.

- **B) TRUE** – Controls are individuals without the disease, selected to represent the source population from which cases arose.

- **C) TRUE** – Case-control studies are typically retrospective, looking back from disease status to prior exposures.

- **D) FALSE** – In a case-control study, you cannot calculate incidence because you select patients based on disease status (cases and controls are often selected in equal numbers). The proportion with disease in your study does not reflect the true population incidence.

- **E) TRUE** – We calculate the odds of exposure among cases and compare it to the odds of exposure among controls to obtain the odds ratio.

</details>

## Question 11: Odds Ratio Interpretation

Which of the following statements about the odds ratio (OR) are TRUE?

- A) OR > 1 indicates increased odds of disease in the exposed group
- B) OR = 1 indicates no association between exposure and disease
- C) OR < 1 indicates reduced odds of disease in the exposed group (protective effect)
- D) The odds ratio approximates the relative risk when the disease is rare
- E) The odds ratio can never be negative

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D, E are all TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – OR > 1 means the odds of disease is higher in those exposed to the risk factor.

- **B) TRUE** – OR = 1 means the odds of disease is the same in exposed and unexposed groups.

- **C) TRUE** – OR < 1 means exposure is associated with lower odds of disease (protective factor).

- **D) TRUE** – When disease prevalence is low (<10%), the odds ratio closely approximates the relative risk. This is called the "rare disease assumption."

- **E) TRUE** – The odds ratio is a ratio of two positive quantities (odds), so it must always be positive (ranging from 0 to infinity).

## Question 12: Odds Ratio Calculation

A case-control study investigates oral contraceptive use and breast cancer:

| Oral Contraceptives | Cases (Breast Cancer) | Controls |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Ever used           | 537                  | 554      |
| Never used          | 639                  | 622      |

Which of the following are TRUE?

- A) The odds of contraceptive use among cases is 537/639
- B) The odds of contraceptive use among controls is 554/622
- C) The odds ratio = (537 × 622)/(554 × 639) = 0.94
- D) The OR of 0.94 indicates a 6% lower odds of breast cancer among contraceptive users
- E) This result suggests oral contraceptives substantially increase breast cancer risk

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Odds in cases = exposed cases / unexposed cases = 537/639 = 0.84.

- **B) TRUE** – Odds in controls = exposed controls / unexposed controls = 554/622 = 0.89.

- **C) TRUE** – OR = (a×d)/(b×c) = (537×622)/(554×639) = 333,914/354,006 = 0.94.

- **D) TRUE** – OR = 0.94 means the odds of breast cancer among contraceptive users is 6% lower than among non-users (1 - 0.94 = 0.06 = 6%).

- **E) FALSE** – OR < 1 actually suggests a slight protective effect (or no meaningful association, given how close to 1.0 it is). It does not suggest increased risk.

## Question 13: Advantages of Cohort Studies

Which of the following are advantages of cohort studies?

- A) Incidence rates can be directly estimated
- B) Multiple outcomes can be studied simultaneously
- C) The time sequence of exposure and disease can be established
- D) They are inexpensive and quick to complete
- E) They are efficient for studying rare diseases

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Because cohort studies follow participants over time, incidence rates can be directly calculated.

- **B) TRUE** – A single cohort can be used to study multiple disease outcomes related to the same exposure.

- **C) TRUE** – By following participants from exposure to outcome, the temporal relationship can be clearly established.

- **D) FALSE** – Cohort studies are typically **expensive** and require **long periods of follow-up**, making them resource-intensive.

- **E) FALSE** – Cohort studies are **not efficient for rare diseases** because you would need to follow a very large cohort to observe enough events. Case-control studies are better for rare diseases.

</details>

## Question 14: Disadvantages of Cohort Studies

Which of the following are disadvantages of cohort studies?

- A) Loss to follow-up can bias results
- B) They require long periods of follow-up for diseases with long latency
- C) They are expensive to conduct
- D) Knowledge of exposure status may bias outcome classification
- E) Participants may change exposure status during the study

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D, E are all TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Loss to follow-up is a major limitation. If participants who drop out differ systematically from those who remain, the results may be biased.

- **B) TRUE** – Diseases that take many years to develop (e.g., many cancers) require very long follow-up periods.

- **C) TRUE** – The resources required to maintain a cohort over many years are substantial.

- **D) TRUE** – If researchers know who is exposed, this may unconsciously influence how they classify outcomes (detection bias).

- **E) TRUE** – Participants may change their exposure (e.g., quit smoking, start exercise), complicating the analysis of exposure-outcome relationships.

</details>

## Question 15: Advantages of Case-Control Studies

Which of the following are advantages of case-control studies?

- A) They are useful for investigating rare diseases
- B) They are relatively quick and inexpensive
- C) Multiple risk factors can be investigated
- D) There is no loss to follow-up
- E) Incidence rates can be directly calculated

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Case-control studies start with people who already have the disease, making them ideal for rare conditions.

- **B) TRUE** – Because they are retrospective and don't require following participants over time, they are faster and cheaper than cohort studies.

- **C) TRUE** – A wide range of potential risk factors can be assessed in each study by asking about multiple exposures.

- **D) TRUE** – Since data are collected at one point in time (retrospectively), participants cannot be lost to follow-up.

- **E) FALSE** – Case-control studies **cannot** estimate incidence because participants are selected based on disease status, not randomly from the population.

</details>

## Question 16: Disadvantages of Case-Control Studies

Which of the following are disadvantages of case-control studies?

- A) Selection of appropriate controls can be difficult
- B) They are subject to recall bias
- C) They cannot establish temporal sequence of events
- D) They are not efficient when exposures are rare
- E) The relative risk cannot be directly estimated

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D, E are all TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Selecting controls who represent the source population from which cases arose is challenging and critical to valid results.

- **B) TRUE** – Cases may remember or report exposures differently than controls (recall bias), particularly if they are seeking explanations for their disease.

- **C) TRUE** – Because exposure and disease have both already occurred, it may be difficult to establish whether exposure preceded disease.

- **D) TRUE** – If the exposure is rare, you may need to interview many cases and controls to find enough exposed individuals.

- **E) TRUE** – Only the odds ratio can be calculated; the relative risk cannot be directly estimated because you cannot calculate incidence from a case-control study.

</details>

## Question 17: Confounding

Which of the following statements about confounding are TRUE?

- A) A confounder is associated with both the exposure and the outcome
- B) A confounder lies on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome
- C) Confounding can lead to a spurious association between exposure and disease
- D) Age is a common confounder in epidemiological studies
- E) Randomisation in clinical trials helps control for confounding

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, C, D, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – To be a confounder, a variable must be associated with both the exposure and the outcome independently.

- **B) FALSE** – A confounder is **not** on the causal pathway. If it were, controlling for it would be inappropriate (it would be a mediator, not a confounder).

- **C) TRUE** – Confounding can make it appear that there is an association when there isn't one, or hide a true association.

- **D) TRUE** – Age is frequently associated with both exposures (e.g., older people have had more time to be exposed) and outcomes (e.g., many diseases are more common with age).

- **E) TRUE** – Randomisation balances both known and unknown confounders between groups, which is why RCTs are considered the gold standard for assessing causation.

</details>

## Question 18: Age Standardisation

A comparison of COVID-19 mortality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups shows higher mortality in the vaccinated group. However, age-standardised rates show the opposite. Which statements are TRUE?

- A) The crude rate comparison may be misleading due to different age distributions
- B) The vaccinated group likely contains more older individuals
- C) Age standardisation controls for differences in age structure between groups
- D) Age-specific mortality rates in the unvaccinated group are higher
- E) This is an example of confounding by age

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D, E are all TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Crude (unadjusted) rates can be misleading when comparing groups with different age structures.

- **B) TRUE** – If vaccination was prioritised for older people, the vaccinated group would have a higher average age.

- **C) TRUE** – Age standardisation uses a standard population to weight age-specific rates, allowing fair comparison.

- **D) TRUE** – Once you account for age (by looking at age-specific rates), the unvaccinated have higher mortality at each age.

- **E) TRUE** – Age is acting as a confounder: it is associated with both vaccination status (exposure) and mortality (outcome).

## Question 19: Bradford-Hill Criteria for Causation

Which of the following are among the Bradford-Hill criteria for assessing causation?

- A) Strength of association – stronger associations are more likely to be causal
- B) Consistency – similar findings across different populations and study designs
- C) Temporal sequence – exposure must precede outcome
- D) Biological gradient – greater exposure leads to greater effect (dose-response)
- E) Statistical significance – p-value must be less than 0.05

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

The Bradford-Hill criteria (1965) include:

- **A) TRUE** – Strength: larger effect sizes are more likely to reflect causation.

- **B) TRUE** – Consistency: the association should be reproducible in different settings.

- **C) TRUE** – Temporality: the exposure must come before the disease.

- **D) TRUE** – Biological gradient (dose-response): more exposure should lead to more disease.

- **E) FALSE** – Statistical significance is not one of the Bradford-Hill criteria. The criteria focus on the nature and plausibility of the association, not p-values.

Other Bradford-Hill criteria include: specificity, biological plausibility, coherence, experiment (reversibility), and analogy.

## Question 20: Correlation vs Causation

A study finds a strong positive correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths. Which of the following statements are TRUE?

- A) This correlation proves that ice cream consumption causes drowning
- B) A confounding variable (e.g., hot weather) could explain this association
- C) Epidemiological studies alone cannot prove causation
- D) Correlation indicates a statistical association between two variables
- E) This is an example of a spurious correlation

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: B, C, D, E are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) FALSE** – Correlation does not prove causation. This is a fundamental principle in epidemiology.

- **B) TRUE** – Hot weather is a likely confounding variable: it increases both ice cream consumption and swimming, leading to more drownings.

- **C) TRUE** – Epidemiological studies can only show that a risk factor is **associated** with disease. They cannot definitively prove causation, though the Bradford-Hill criteria can strengthen causal inference.

- **D) TRUE** – Correlation measures the statistical relationship between variables but does not imply one causes the other.

- **E) TRUE** – A spurious correlation is an apparent association that arises due to confounding or chance rather than a true causal relationship.

## Question 21: Comparing Study Designs

Match each measure to the appropriate study design. Which pairings are CORRECT?

- A) Prevalence → Cross-sectional study
- B) Incidence rate → Cohort study
- C) Relative risk → Cohort study
- D) Odds ratio → Case-control study
- E) Incidence → Case-control study

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are CORRECT**

**Explanation:**

- **A) CORRECT** – Cross-sectional studies measure disease status at one point in time, providing prevalence estimates.

- **B) CORRECT** – Cohort studies follow participants over time, allowing calculation of incidence rates.

- **C) CORRECT** – Cohort studies provide incidence data needed to calculate relative risk (ratio of incidences).

- **D) CORRECT** – Case-control studies calculate odds ratios because incidence cannot be directly measured.

- **E) INCORRECT** – Case-control studies **cannot** measure incidence because participants are selected based on disease status, not sampled from the population at risk.

## Question 22: Routinely Collected Data

Which of the following are sources of routinely collected data used in epidemiology?

- A) Death certification records
- B) Cancer registration data
- C) Hospital discharge records
- D) National census data
- E) Randomised controlled trial results

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D are TRUE**

**Explanation:**

- **A) TRUE** – Death certificates provide data on mortality rates and causes of death.

- **B) TRUE** – Cancer registries record cancer diagnoses and outcomes, enabling surveillance of cancer incidence and survival.

- **C) TRUE** – Hospital discharge records provide information on diagnoses, procedures, and healthcare utilisation.

- **D) TRUE** – Census data provides population denominators and demographic information essential for calculating rates.

- **E) FALSE** – RCT results are specifically collected for research purposes, not routinely collected administrative data.

## Summary of Key Learning Points

After completing these questions, ensure you understand:

**Epidemiological Concepts:**

1. **Epidemiology** is the study of the occurrence and determinants of ill health in populations
2. Observational studies include **cross-sectional**, **cohort**, and **case-control** designs
3. **Prospective** studies follow forward from exposure; **retrospective** studies look back from outcome

**Measures of Disease Frequency:**

4. **Prevalence** = proportion with disease at a point in time (cross-sectional studies)
5. **Incidence** = new cases over time (cohort studies)
6. **Incidence rate** uses person-time to account for variable follow-up

**Measures of Association:**

7. **Relative risk (RR)** = ratio of incidences (cohort studies)
   - RR > 1: increased risk; RR = 1: no association; RR < 1: decreased risk

8. **Odds ratio (OR)** = ratio of odds (case-control studies)
   - OR approximates RR when disease is rare

**Study Design Selection:**

| Study Design | Direction | Main Measure | Best For |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Cross-sectional | Single time point | Prevalence | Describing current health status |
| Cohort | Forward (prospective) | Relative Risk | Assessing incidence and causation |
| Case-control | Backward (retrospective) | Odds Ratio | Investigating rare diseases |

**Causation:**

9. **Confounding** occurs when a third variable is associated with both exposure and outcome
10. **Bradford-Hill criteria** help assess whether an association is likely to be causal
11. **Correlation does not prove causation**
